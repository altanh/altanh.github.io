# Altan Haan / Resume

## Professional Experience
**Graduate Student Researcher, UC Berkeley EECS**, Berkeley, CA. (Aug. 2022 - May 2025)

- Conducted **research in compilers and high-performance computing** as part of my
  PhD program in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
- [Optimized sparse matrix multiplication algorithms on NUMA shared-memory systems.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596518) Interned at the
  Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) in 2023 as part of this work.
- Investigated **database query optimization techniques** in the context of sparse
  computing (especially graph algorithms).
- Built prototype **e-graph based optimizing compilers**, and worked on natively
  supporting SSA-style intermediate representations in e-graphs.

**Senior Software Engineer, OctoML**, Seattle, WA. (Sep. 2020 - Aug. 2022)

- Worked broadly on the **Apache TVM Deep Learning Compiler**.
- Fixed lots of bugs in the compiler!
- **Adapted and implemented core optimizing compiler passes**, including liveness
  analysis which reduced memory usage by 10x in the VM runtime.
- **Developed a prototype deep learning training library on top of TVM**, as part
  of a multi-million dollar contract with AMD. **Demonstrated feasibility of training
  models (BERT and DLRM) on prototype AMD hardware** (MI50 and MI100, unreleased at
  the time).

## Education
**PhD in Computer Science, UC Berkeley EECS**, Berkeley, CA. (Aug. 2022 - on leave)

- Currently on leave, looking to work more directly in the industry.
- **Graduate-level coursework:** Reinforcement Learning, Parallel Computing, Database Theory, Database Systems, Compiler Optimization and Code Generation.

**BS in Computer Science, University of Washington**, Seattle, WA. (Sep. 2016 - Jun. 2020)

- Cum Laude, Departmental Honors, with a Minor in Mathematics.
- Enrolled after middle school as part of UW's Early Entrance Program.
- **Graduate-level coursework:** [Formal Methods](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse507/19au/index.html), [Programming Languages](https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/cse-505-spring-2020).
